## 🔄 PHASE 2 — CONVERSATION MEMORY + HR LLM (NEXT)

### Step 1 — Conversation Memory System
- [ ] Create `conversation_memory` table in DB:
  - `session_id`, `question_id`, `question_text`, `user_answer`, `score`, `topic`, `timestamp`
- [ ] Memory Manager service (`services/memory_service.py`):
  - Save each Q&A interaction to memory
  - Retrieve last 3 interactions (memory window)
- [ ] Connect memory to interview flow:
  - After each answer → update memory
  - Before next question → read memory

### Step 2 — Follow-Up Question Logic
- [ ] Add `follow_up_questions` field to questions table (list of question IDs)
- [ ] Follow-up trigger logic:
  - score >= 8 → ask follow-up on same topic
  - score 5–7 → next question same difficulty
  - score < 5 → reduce difficulty
- [ ] Update `GET /interview/question` to support follow-up mode

### Step 3 — Adaptive Interview Engine
- [ ] Create `ai_engine/adaptive_engine.py`
- [ ] Session state tracking:
  - current topic, current difficulty, question number
- [ ] Difficulty progression logic:
  - score >= 8 → upgrade difficulty
  - score 5–7 → keep same
  - score < 5 → downgrade
- [ ] Topic queue system (Arrays → Trees → Graphs etc.)
- [ ] Avoid question repetition within a session

### Step 4 — HR LLM Engine (Ollama + Llama)
- [ ] Install and configure Ollama locally
- [ ] Pull Llama model (`ollama pull llama3`)
- [ ] Create `ai_engine/hr_engine.py`:
  - Prompt design for behavioral evaluation
  - Parse JSON response (clarity, leadership, communication, structure)
  - Return HR score + feedback
- [ ] Connect HR engine to answer submission for Behavioral subject
- [ ] Update score aggregator for HR formula:
  - 40% LLM score
  - 30% Voice (placeholder until Phase 3)
  - 20% Face (placeholder until Phase 4)
  - 10% NLP

---

## 🎤 PHASE 3 — VOICE ANALYSIS

### Step 1 — Audio Capture (Frontend)
- [ ] Add `MediaRecorder` API to InterviewRoom
- [ ] Record audio while user types/speaks answer
- [ ] Send audio blob to backend (`POST /interview/voice`)

### Step 2 — Voice Analysis Engine (Backend)
- [ ] Install `librosa`, `parselmouth`, `SpeechRecognition`
- [ ] Create `ai_engine/voice_engine.py`:
  - Extract features:
    - Speaking rate (words per minute)
    - Pause frequency
    - Pitch variation / stability
    - Filler word detection (um, uh, like)
  - Voice score formula:
    - 30% Fluency
    - 25% Pace
    - 25% Pitch stability
    - 20% Filler word control

### Step 3 — Integrate Voice Score
- [ ] Add `voice_score` to answers table
- [ ] Update score aggregator:
  - Technical: 70% NLP + 20% Voice + 10% Face
  - HR: 40% LLM + 30% Voice + 20% Face + 10% NLP
- [ ] Show voice breakdown in frontend result card

---

## 👁️ PHASE 4 — FACE ANALYSIS

### Step 1 — Video Capture (Frontend)
- [ ] Add `WebRTC` / `getUserMedia` to InterviewRoom
- [ ] Show live camera feed during interview
- [ ] Capture frames and send to backend (`POST /interview/vision`)

### Step 2 — Face Analysis Engine (Backend)
- [ ] Install `opencv-python`, `mediapipe`
- [ ] Create `ai_engine/vision_engine.py`:
  - Detect features:
    - Eye contact ratio (frames with eye contact / total frames)
    - Head movement / stability
    - Emotion detection (calm, nervous, confident)
  - Face score formula:
    - 40% Eye contact
    - 30% Head stability
    - 30% Emotional consistency

### Step 3 — Integrate Face Score
- [ ] Add `face_score` to answers table
- [ ] Update score aggregator with face score
- [ ] Show face breakdown in frontend result card

---

## 📊 PHASE 5 — ADVANCED ANALYTICS & DASHBOARD

- [ ] Score progression chart over time (line chart)
- [ ] Per-topic radar chart (strengths vs weaknesses)
- [ ] Confidence trend tracking (voice + face over sessions)
- [ ] Interview history page (past sessions list)
- [ ] Session detail view (all Q&As with scores)
- [ ] Downloadable performance report (PDF)
- [ ] Recommendations engine:
  - "You should practice Dynamic Programming more"
  - "Your voice confidence improved by 12% this week"

---

## 🤖 PHASE 6 — AI AVATAR INTERVIEWER

- [ ] AI avatar UI component (`components/AIAvatar.jsx`)
  - Animated talking head or simple visual
- [ ] Text-to-speech for questions (browser Web Speech API or ElevenLabs)
- [ ] Context-aware follow-up generation using Ollama:
  - Send last answer → generate follow-up question
  - Prompt: "Based on this answer, ask a deeper follow-up"
- [ ] Conversation mode:
  - AI speaks question
  - User speaks answer
  - AI responds with feedback + next question
- [ ] Interview personality modes:
  - Friendly (campus interviews)
  - Strict (FAANG style)
  - HR (behavioral focused)

---

## 🚀 PHASE 7 — DEPLOYMENT

### Backend
- [ ] Dockerize FastAPI app
- [ ] Deploy on Render (free tier)
- [ ] Set up environment variables (DB, JWT secret)
- [ ] Configure CORS for production

### Frontend
- [ ] Build React app (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Deploy on Vercel
- [ ] Connect to production backend URL

### Database
- [ ] Migrate PostgreSQL to Render managed DB
  or use Supabase (free PostgreSQL hosting)

|-------|------|--------|
| Phase 1 | Auth + NLP Engine + Question Bank + Frontend | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 2 | Conversation Memory + Follow-ups + Adaptive Engine + Ollama HR | 🔲 Next |
| Phase 3 | Voice Analysis (librosa + parselmouth) | 🔲 Pending |
| Phase 4 | Face Analysis (OpenCV + MediaPipe) | 🔲 Pending |
| Phase 5 | Advanced Analytics + Charts + Reports | 🔲 Pending |
| Phase 6 | AI Avatar + Conversation Mode + TTS | 🔲 Pending |

## 💡 NOTES

- Do phases in order — each builds on the previous
- Phase 2 has zero new library installs (except Ollama) — good starting point
- Voice and face need hardware testing — do locally first
- Keep question bank growing — more questions = better interviews
- Every phase = a new talking point in your placement interviews
